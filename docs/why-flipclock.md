# Why FlipClock.js?

FlipClock.js is a years long passion project that has been re-written many times that started on jQuery, long before TypeScript and adopted thousands of stars on Github. Over the years, the technical debt stacked up and other projects took priority. Next thing I know, years have past and a modern FlockClock.js is long overdue.

It's the old adage, write once to figure out the problem, write twice to solve it. In the case of FlipClock, it took more than two times. I've attempted to rewrite the library several times over the years with several tech stacks. Each time coming back to the project with new ideas, more experience, and simpler ways to express concept ideas in code.

FlipClock.js became my way to explore a singular narrow concept as far as I can, do it the best I possibly can, without any shortcuts, without any runtime dependencies, with great docs, and have fun doing it. I hope you enjoy using FlipClock.js as much as I did writing it.
