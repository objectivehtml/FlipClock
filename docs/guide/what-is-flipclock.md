# Introduction

FlipClock.js is an open source library written in Typescript designed for building clocks, counters, scoreboards, flipboards and more.

The goal is provide well-tested, strongly typed, and flexible API's that are easy and straight forward to use. The codebase is well-documented and we strongly encourage community contribution and feedback.

## How It Works
