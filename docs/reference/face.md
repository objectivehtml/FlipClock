# Face

`Face` is an interface that is implemented by [Alphanumeric](./alphanumeric.md), [Clock](./clock.md), [ElapsedTime](./elapsed-time.md) and [Counter](./counter.md). The `Face` interface must be implemented if you are creating your own face. In addition to the required methods, all the [Event Hook](./event-hooks.md) methods are available too.
